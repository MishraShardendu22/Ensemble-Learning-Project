# Ensemble Learning Project

A repository demonstrating ensemble machine learning techniques (bagging, boosting, stacking) for classification and regression problems. The project contains code, experiments, and notebooks to train, evaluate, and compare ensemble models and baseline learners.

## Project Overview

This project implements and benchmarks several ensemble learning methods, including:
- Bagging (Random Forests, Bagged Decision Trees)
- Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost / LightGBM compatibility)
- Stacking / Blending (meta-models combining base learners)

The goal is to provide reproducible training pipelines and comparison scripts, along with example notebooks that walk through data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Features
- Reusable training and evaluation pipeline (CLI and/or notebook)
- Implementations and wrappers for popular libraries (scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm)
- Cross-validation, grid/random search, and simple logging of metrics
- Experiment scripts that produce plots and result tables
- Example notebooks for guided learning and demonstration

## Dataset(s)

This repository does not bundle large datasets. Example datasets used in the notebooks and experiments include:
- UCI Machine Learning Repository datasets (e.g., Iris, Wine, Adult)
- Kaggle datasets (link to dataset used in a specific experiment should be included in the corresponding notebook)

Place your dataset files in a `data/` directory or update the paths in the config used by the scripts/notebooks.

## Installation

Recommended: create a virtual environment.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MishraShardendu22/Ensemble-Learning-Project.git
cd Ensemble-Learning-Project
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3. Install dependencies (if a requirements file exists):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you prefer Conda, use `environment.yml` if present.

## Quick Start / Usage

Run a training experiment (example):

```bash
# train a model using default config
python src/train.py --config configs/default.yaml

# evaluate a saved model
python src/evaluate.py --model-path outputs/models/model.pkl --data data/test.csv
```

Open the notebooks in `notebooks/` to explore step-by-step examples, visualizations, and walkthroughs.

## Training & Evaluation

- The `src/` directory contains scripts for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Experiments save logs, metric summaries, and trained model artifacts under `outputs/` by default.
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter search are supported via scikit-learn `GridSearchCV` / `RandomizedSearchCV` or custom search wrappers.

## Experiments and Results

Example experiments are stored in `experiments/` (or referenced in notebooks). Each experiment should include:
- config file (hyperparameters, data paths)
- run scripts or command used to launch the experiment
- results summary (CSV or JSON)
- plots (ROC, precision-recall, feature importance)

Add your own experiment folder when running new comparisons. Commit only small artifacts or summaries; large artifacts should be stored externally or in release assets.

Adjust the structure above to match the actual layout in this repository.

## How to Reproduce Results

1. Prepare a dataset and place it in `data/` or update the config paths.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run the provided training script with the recommended config: `python src/train.py --config configs/default.yaml`.
4. Run evaluation script(s) to generate metrics and plots.

Tip: use a fixed random seed in config to ensure reproducible splits and model behaviour. Log the commit SHA and environment details when running important experiments.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please:
- Open an issue for bugs or feature requests
- Create a branch for your work and open a pull request
- Add tests for new functionality when possible
- Keep large datasets and binary artifacts out of the repository; store them in cloud storage and document download steps
